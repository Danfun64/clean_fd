Title                   : Freedoom Clean 1.3
Filename                : clean-fd.wad

Description             : This is meant to remove blood, gore, and demonic
                          imagery from Freedoom. This was made so that a
                          fairly-clean Free Software single player fps can
                          be used. If you aren't a Free Software user, use
                          Chex Quest instead.
                          
                          I give permission for this file to be included or
                          bundled in/with freedoom and license it under the
                          3-clause BSD license. The modified levels also use
						  the FreeDoom varient of said license.
						  
						  In order to avoid mixing resources, Ultimate Freedoom
						  and Freedoom content have been split. In addition,
						  pentagrams on the levels themselves have been
						  removed. Note that those levels will no longer
						  be compatible with demos recorded for them from
						  the original game.
						  
						  NOTE FOR THOSE USING 1.1A, delete mbfcomp.deh, as
						  it's contents have been included in this patch
						  
						  NOTE: The new enemies have been recentered.
						  
						  NOTE: I decided to make a brand new release
						  which contains every change I have made thus far,
						  which should fix a few bugs. Sorry for not releasing
						  this sooner.
						  
						  NOTE: The new enemies have been removed, they just
						  don't mix with the regular game. They have also been
						  causing problems...
